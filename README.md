# Ping-Pong
This is the 2 nd project i am uploading out of the many i have done. I have not created this game nor the whole code is original. As i dont know CSS i have been helped by my friend. The javascript code is written by me but i have taken hints from other websites. The inspiration of this project is not mine i had seen it in a page called top 10 projects for beginners so the design is also heavily influenced. The component sizes are not changed and have been kept same as per the project to minimise errors.

I still need to add probability in the AI to give the player the chance to win, The current code is not good for actual user experience.If you can help in adding probability please submit a pull request.

This project was done in 2017 and has not been touched since just decided to upload on github now
